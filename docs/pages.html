	<h2>Working with Pages</h2>
	
	<p>Pages are just files with a <code>.html</code> extension that reside in the <code>/site/pages</code> directory.</p>
	
	<p>All requests for pages are routed into this directory, which means that (at it's simplest) when Prontotype sees a request for <code>http://example.com/account/test</code> it will look for a page that lives at <code>/site/pages/account/test.html</code>. If it doesn't find a page there it'll look for a file at <code>/site/pages/account/test/index.html</code>, and if it <em>still</em> doesn't find anything it'll display a 404 page.</p>
	
	<p>So you can basically structure your pages directory just like you would a normal, basic, HTML site.</p>
	
	<p>However&hellip; files in the pages directory are also <strong>parsed as Twig templates</strong>. That means you can use a <a href="/docs/template-tags">whole bunch of template tags</a> within them to give you access to data, include other files, inherit layouts and more.</p>
