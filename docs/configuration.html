<p>Prontotype's default configuration should probably be just fine for you. But if you do want to tweak any of the settings, you can do so in the YAML configuration file <code>config.yml</code> found in the root of your Prontotype install.</p>

<p>Here's a brief overview of the settings, what they do and their default values:</p>

<!-- table>
	<thead>
	<tr>
		<th>Name</th>
		<th>Description</th>
		<th>Default</th>
	</tr>			
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td></td>
			<td></td>
			<td></td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table -->


<p>Note that deleting a setting from the <code>config.yml</code> file will cause it to revert to it's default.</p>
