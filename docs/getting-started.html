	<p>Prontotype makes use of <a href="http://twig.sensiolabs.org/">Twig</a> to power it's templates and <a href="http://yaml.org/start.html">YAML</a> as a way to store structured data in text files. It's highly recommended to familiarise yourself with them before starting as understanding them well will mean you can really get the most out of Prontotype.</p>

		<li><a href="https://github.com/allmarkedup/prontotype/zipball/master">Download</a> and unzip the latest version (or clone it from the <a href="https://github.com/allmarkedup/prontotype">Github repo</a>).</li>
		<li>Move the files to the web root of your server</li>
		<li>Change the filename of the htaccess.txt file to .htaccess (this may make it an 'invisible' file, depending on your OS)</li>
