		<h2>Pages</h2>
		
		<h3>Overview</h3>
	
		<p>Pages are just files with a <code>.html</code> extension that reside in the <code>/structure/pages</code> directory.</p>
	
		<p>All requests for pages are routed into this directory, which means that (at it's simplest) when Prontotype sees a request for <code>http://example.com/account/test</code> it will look for a page that lives at <code>/structure/pages/account/test.html</code>. If it doesn't find a page there it'll look for a file at <code>/structure/pages/account/test/index.html</code>, and if it <em>still</em> doesn't find anything it'll display a 404 page.</p>
	
		<p>So you can basically structure your pages directory just like you would a simple HTML site.</p>
	
		<p>However&hellip; files in the pages directory are also <strong>parsed as Twig templates</strong>. That means you can use a <a href="/docs/template-tags.html">whole bunch of template tags</a> within them to give you access to data, include other files, inherit layouts and more.</p>
		
	<h3>Ordering pages</h3>
	
	<p>To keep your files ordered nicely in your directories (and to control order that they are output from things like the navigation <a href="/macros-examples">macros</a>), you can also prefix the filename with a number followed by a dash, underscore or full stop (period). This ordering information will not show up in the URL.</p>
	
	<p>So using the above example again, but including some ordering information, a file at <code>/site/pages/about/<strong>1-</strong>company.html</code> will still be accessible at <code>http://example.com/about/company</code> and will be the first file in the 'about' section.</p>
	
	<h3>Page IDs</h3>
	
	<p>Lastly, you can give pages unique IDs, and use these to build links to pages so that if you move the pages around (which happens a lot when prototyping!) you won't have to update all your links.</p>
	
	<p>You can give a page and ID by adding an alphanumeric string (underscores and dashes are ok in there too) surrounded by square brackets into the filename. You can also follow this by a dash, underscore or full stop (period) to help seperate it from the rest of the filename, of you wish.</p>
	
	<p>The ID string, like the ordering prefix, will not show up in the URL. So a page at <code>/site/pages/about/<strong>[c123]-</strong>company.html</code> will have a page ID of <code>c123</code> and will be shown at the URL <code>http://example.com/about/company</code></p>
	
	<p>Once your page has an ID, you can always print it's current URL into your template by using:</p>
	
	<p><code>{% raw %}{{ pages.link('PAGE-ID') }}{% endraw %}</code></p>
	
	<p>Where <code>PAGE-ID</code> is the ID of the page you are interested in.</p>
	
	<h3>Bringing it all together</h3>
	
	<p>You can of course mix ordering with pages ids - so combining the examples above we would have a page that sits at <code>/site/pages/about/<strong>1-[c123]-</strong>company.html</code> which is found at the URL <code>http://example.com/about/company</code>, is the first page in the 'about' section and has a page ID of <code>c123</code></p>
